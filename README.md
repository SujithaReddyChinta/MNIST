MNIST, short for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, is a benchmark dataset in machine learning.
Comprising 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9), it serves as a standard for evaluating algorithms in image classification tasks.
Each grayscale image is 28x28 pixels, making it manageable yet challenging for learning algorithms. MNIST has been instrumental in advancing the field of 
deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Its simplicity facilitates rapid prototyping and benchmarking of new algorithms.
Despite its age, MNIST remains relevant, serving as a foundational dataset for studying image recognition and classification algorithms.
